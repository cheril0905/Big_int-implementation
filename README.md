# 💻 Big Integer Arithmetic in C

This is a C program that performs **addition**, **subtraction**, and **multiplication** on arbitrarily large integers (up to 309 digits), without relying on built-in big integer libraries. It handles both **positive** and **negative** values and includes input validation to prevent buffer overflow.
